    gaussian(a...; mean=0.0, std=0.01)

Return a Gaussian array with a given mean and standard deviation.  The
`a` arguments are passed to `randn`.

    xavier(a...)

Xavier initialization returns uniform random weights in the range `Â±sqrt(2 / (fanin +
fanout))`.  The `a` arguments are passed to `rand`.  See ([Glorot and Bengio
2010](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf)) for a description.
[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/doxygen/classcaffe_1_1XavierFiller.html#details)
implements this slightly differently.
[Lasagne](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/init.html#lasagne.init.GlorotUniform)
calls it `GlorotUniform`.

Bilinear interpolation filter weights; used for initializing deconvolution layers.

Adapted from https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org/blob/master/surgery.py#L33

Arguments:

`T` : Data Type

`fw`: Width upscale factor

`fh`: Height upscale factor

`IN`: Number of input filters

`ON`: Number of output filters


Example usage:

w = bilinear(Float32,2,2,128,128)
